the invention of the computor language known as code has opened up many paths for creation and inovation. One of the leading languages right now is JavaScript, Which is a versitile object-orriented coding language created in C++. 

There are many tools in your disposal when using JavaScript. One of the more well known ones is called inheritance. inheritance is a command that allows you to easily and efficiently make multiple classes. Here is how it works. You make a class and you want to make multiple other classes built off that one. Instead of recreating the class inside every folder, you can instead export it and import the same class into other folders that you wish to impliment that class into. You can think of it as creating a cookie cutter from the exported class and cutting out a cookie for your .js folders.
